# glyphic
A symbolic sandbox for exploring the emotional, logical, and motion characteristics of glyphs. 
This project is the beginning of a new digital languageâ€”a fusion of art, code, and symbolic intelligence. Each glyph is more than a shape: it holds emotional resonance, movement logic, and conceptual meaning.

## Vision
The sandbox allows users to:
- Input symbolic glyphs
- Receive poetic, emotional, and visual responses
- Explore an interface between human intuition and machine expression

The underlying engine is proprietary and not exposed in this repo.
